## LiteSupport - Back-End Repo

This is the back-end of my final capstone project at Nashville Software School. LiteSupport is a small scale version of a customer support / issue tracking system. Employees can create customers, new employees, tickets and comment on tickets as they track design requests and/or bug fixes in their customers' websites.

The back-end uses technologies including .NET, C# and SQL.
